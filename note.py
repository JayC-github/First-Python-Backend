requirements analysis-> design -> development -> testing -> 
deployment -> maintenance

1. functional/ non-functional compoents
a specific service that the system should provide
send notification

how the system achieve that, performance characteristic
send email no later than 30 minss

2. deployment = ship it
3. maintenance = monitor

# standups        
1. what did i do?
2. what problems did i face?
3. what I'm going to do?  

Asynchronous Stand-ups
pro: no need to find a suitable time for everyone
con: missed updates, less personal

Test-Driven-Development
(TDD)
Writing tests before the implementation
Write only enough code to make the next test pass

# week06 design principles
design smell:
Rigidity: Tendency to be too difficult to change
Fragility: Tendency for software to break when
single change is made
Immobility: Previous work is hard to reuse or move
Viscosity: Changes feel very slow to implement
Opacity: Difficult to understand
Needless complexity:  Things done more complex
than they should be
Needless repetition: Lack of unified structures
Coupling: Interdependence between components

DRY -- don't repeat urself (reducing repitition in the code)
kiss -- keep it simple and stupid
top-down thinking -- you aren't gonna need it

Acceptance Tests are tests that are performed to
ensure acceptance criteria have been met -- black box

import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    sys.exit(1)

    result = i ** num
    print(f"{i} ** {num} = {result}")

### being pythonic

1. Docstrings
2. map/reduce/filter/lambda

### map: creates a new list with the results of calling a provided
function on every element in the given list

def shout(string):
    return string.upper() + "!!!!"
if __name__ == '__main__':
    tutors = ['Simon', 'Teresa', 'Kaiqi', 'Michelle']
    shout_tutors = list(map(shout, tutors))
    print(shout_tutors)        

### reduce: executes a reducer function (that you provide) on
each member of the array resulting in a single output value

# importing functools for reduce() 
import functools 
  
# initializing list 
lis = [ 1, 3, 5, 6, 2] 

def sum_two(a, b):
    return a + b

# using reduce to compute sum of list 
print ("***The sum of the list elements is : ",end="") 
print (functools.reduce(sum_two, lis)) 

  
# using reduce to compute sum of list 
print ("The sum of the list elements is : ",end="") 
print (functools.reduce(lambda a,b : a+b, lis)) 
  
# using reduce to compute maximum element from list 
print ("The maximum element of the list is : ",end="") 
print (functools.reduce(lambda a,b : a if a > b else b, lis)) 



### filter: creates a new array with all elements that pass the
test implemented by the provided function

marks = [64,73,81,49,43,50]

passing_marks = list(filter(lambda x: x >= 50, marks))
print(passing_marks)    

3. exceptions > early returns
4. enumerate

a = int(input("enter a number:"))
b = int(input("enter another number:"))

jay, mercy = a,b

print(jay)
print(mercy)

players = ["kobe", "lebron", "jordan", "wade"]

for i, player in enumerate(players):
    print(f"{i}, {player}")

######## 9 python generators and iterators  
An iterator has __iter__() and __next()__ methods.
Iterables have __iter__() methods

    print(item + "aaaaaaaa")
